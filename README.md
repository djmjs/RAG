# Customer Support Language Model
This project is about building a Customer Support Language Model (LLM) using techniques like Prompt Engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and LoRA. The aim is to improve how the model responds to customer inquiries by making it more accurate and context-aware.
